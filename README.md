High-level:

1. Frontend UI sends requests to backend (REST API)  
2. Backend handles business logic, interacts with DB  
3. For media (images), you upload to storage service (Cloudinary etc.)  
4. Backend issues JWT tokens for authenticated sessions  
5. Users follow each other; feed built from following relationships
